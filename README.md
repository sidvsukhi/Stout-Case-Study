Stout Case Study Assessment

This repository is divided into 2 sections-
1. Case Study 1 - loan schema data
2. Case Study 2 - year-wise revenue data

Note- Please comment the data loading line and uncomment the line to load data.

Each section has the dataset, jupyter notebook, and 1 HTML file showing final output.

I have completely finished the Case Study 2. In Case Study 1, I have tried my best and partially solved it to get the visualizations.
